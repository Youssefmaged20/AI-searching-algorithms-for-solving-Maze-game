# AI-searching-algorithms-for-solving-Maze-game

In this project we will be implementing a maze game where we used 3 different search techniques which are A star, Greedy and Uniform cost.
We first imported a library called turtle that will be used throughout the game which enabled us to use the turtle as an object to show the path of the 3 used techniques, The user will have the ability to choose among the 3 algorithms.
a map will be drawn and the turtle will have different start point and goal point at each time.
the intial state and the end state will be shown to the user along with the steps that it took the turtle to reach the end goal using the chosen algorithm
